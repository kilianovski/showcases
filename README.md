# What is it?

Explaining a concept is the best way to learn and understand it, right?

<br />So, here I am explaining and providing examples for different things that I am learning sometimes.

The main purpose is just gain understanding of the topic and persists notes and examples.

<br />So, my main audience are `.md` files, but if you are looking there and seeing that something is wrong or you are feeling angry, please, contact me :)
